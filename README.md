### Description
__*A webpage that does cryptosquares.*__

[A classic method for composing secret messages is called a square code.](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming/arrays-looping/practice-roman-numerals)

The spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle) and the entire message is downcased. For example, the sentence "don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to the person you were yesterday" is 69 characters long, so it is written into a rectangle with 8 rows and 9 columns.

Write a program that, given a block of text, outputs the encoded version of that text.

The size of the square (number of columns) should be decided by the length of the message. If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc), use that number of columns. If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, choose the number of columns that corresponds to the smallest square that is larger than the number of characters in the message.

Output the encoded text in groups of five letters.
